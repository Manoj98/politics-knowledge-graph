## DESCRIPTION

Our project, REP-G, is a visualization tool that aims to help United States citizens, residents, and immigrants to better understand the roles that their elected representatives play and key politicians for and against policies within Congress.

Given a political topic/subtopic, our tool displays various "clusters" (or groups of politicans) that vote together similarly on it, and details about their names, political affiliations, committee memberships, and lobbyist relations.

## INSTALLATION

Run the following commands:
1. "pip install -r requirements.txt"
2. "python src/visualization/app.py"

Then, on a browser, navigate to http://127.0.0.1:8050/

## EXECUTION

Upon opening the app, follow the instructions to use it:
1. From the dropdown on the top, select a topic.
2. Select a subtopic (node) on the graph on the upper left.
3. Select a piece of the pie chart on the upper right.
4. Visualizations of that cluster will be displayed on the bottom panel - specifically, statistics of the cluster computed from our knowledge graph. Feel free to move your mouse around to reveal tooltips.
